## LBC Projects Repository Design

## 1. Problem Statement

Learn and Be Curious Projects Repository (LBC-PR) is a service to save past LBC projects so future students
can check and be inspired for their own projects ideas. 


## 2. Top Questions to Resolve in Review

1. In the table "project", should the title of the project be the primary key or should I use an id ?  
2. Should I use date for beginning and end date of the projects ? Will I be able to deal with date fields ?
3. Should I use combo-box for the course ? Will I be able to deal with combo-box ?
4. Should I use a list for the team members ? or use dev1, dev2, dev3 and dev4 strings ?

## 3. Use Cases

U1. As a [LBCPR] user, I want to be able to register a project with a title, course, year, description, git url,
and the dev team(name, List of members).  <br>
U2. As a [LBCPR] user, I want to view a list of all past LBC projects when I access the service.  <br>
U3. As a [LBCPR] user, I want to select a project from the list to view more details of the project.  <br>
U4. As a [LBCPR] user, I want to be able to update the: title, description, gitUrl, the team and devs names.


## 4. Project Scope

### 4.1. In Scope

* Create a project.
* List all projects.
* Update a project.

### 4.2. Out of Scope

* Search a project by any specific field.
* Manage a team.
* Manage courses.
* Delete operations.

# 5. Proposed Architecture Overview

* This service will provide the functionalities to create, update and list all the projects.
* We will use the API Gateway and Lambda to create four endpoints (GetAllProjects, GetProject, UpdateProject, CreateProject).
* Projects and Teams will be stored in separated tables in DynamoDB. 
* We will provide a web interface to create, view, update and list of all projects.
